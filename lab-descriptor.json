    "introduction": "The Harmonic Motion and Waves Virtual Lab offers an interactive, simulation-based learning environment designed to enhance students' understanding of fundamental wave phenomena and oscillatory motion. This laboratory includes classic experiments such as Melde’s String Apparatus, Kundt’s Tube, Ultrasonic Interferometer, Doppler Effect, and A.C. Sonometer, each demonstrating key physical principles including frequency determination, wave propagation in solids and liquids, acoustic resonance, and the effect of motion on perceived sound frequency.<br><br>By replicating these experiments virtually, the lab provides learners with an opportunity to visualize complex concepts, manipulate experimental parameters, and engage in inquiry-based exploration—making it an essential resource for accessible, scalable, and concept-driven physics education.",
